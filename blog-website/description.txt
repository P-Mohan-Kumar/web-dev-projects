This repository contains a simple blog application built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts. The application has the following features:

Create: Users can create new blog posts with titles and content.
Read: Displays all existing blog posts with their titles and content.
Update: Users can edit existing blog posts by modifying their titles and content.
Delete: Allows users to remove blog posts from the application.
The application's frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It fetches data from the backend server powered by Node.js and Express. MongoDB is used as the database to store blog post information.

This project demonstrates basic CRUD operations in a web application using a modern JavaScript stack, making it a good starting point for learning web development concepts
